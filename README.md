I grew up in the caribbean where we are raised up by what you can say is communoty upbringing. It is a bit of a safe practice for parents because that way everyone holds a child responsible and parents tend to always know what happens. children are brought up with the discipline to greet everyone when passing and to respect everyone around there. This doesnt mean that you dont get a few bad apples amoung kids, but it is way less of a chance for kids to turn out being bad apple with this method from my observation.
